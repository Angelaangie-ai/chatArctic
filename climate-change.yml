- - Why is the Arctic important in the climate change crisis?
  - The Arctic is central to climate risks because it has a disproportionately strong effect on climate and weather in the rest of the world. The Arctic helps regulate the world's climate, influencing the Earth's atmospheric circulation systems.
  - It has direct and indirect impacts on extreme heat and cold.
  - It warms at least three times faster than the rest of the planet.
- - What are the risks of the melting?
  - Extreme weather and sea level rise.
  - Supply chain disruption and heat stress.
  - Accelerates melting of the Greenland ice sheet - which contains the equivalent of 7.4m of sea level rise.
- - What is currently happening at the Arctic?
  - Arctic sea ice in winter, 2022, experienced the second earliest sea ice maximum due in part to heat waves in March.
  - This resulted in significant deterioration in sea ice concentrations to the east of Greenland.
- - What are some examples for extreme weather?
  - There were Arctic wildfires in Siberia.
  - In the spring 2022, there were a record number of tornadoes that pummelled in the United States.
  - Pakistan hit the warmest temperatures in 121 years.
- - How does the Arctic puts food security at risk?
  - It contributes to the risk of crop failures due to jet stream changes.
  - Extreme summer events disrupt the effective water management.
- - How does the Arctic influence the economic cost of climate change?
  - Recent extreme events like wildfires in Australia and the US have caused billions of USD worth of economic damage each.
  - Arctic warming alone is estimated for around 5% of all costs to climate change.
  - A small amount of these losses is occuring in the Arctic region itself, affecting indigenous communities who have adapted to live in harsh conditions.
  - - What are the pressures that Arctic communities are facing?
  - Damages to infrastructure.
  - Growing wildfires.
- - How do we stay out of fossil fuels?
  - Government should ensure no new investments in fossil fuel development are made.
  - Banks should not finance oil, gas or ming projects in the Arctic.
  - We must keep banks like JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, Citi and Wells Fargo accountable to their pledges to not fund oil and gas.
- - How can we define a business roadmap for climate action?
  - The roadmap will require coordinated action to push forward the emission mitigation options, highlighted by the IPCC: demand management, energy and materials efficiency, circular material flows, as well as abatement technologies and transformational changes in production processes.
  - The carbon capture technology can help hard-to-abate sectors achieve net-zero, but should be used with caution.
- - How to reduce black carbon emissions?
  - Businesses who run or benefit from commercial shipping routes through the Arctic should immediately stop heavy fuel use.
  - Exemptions and allowances in its current proposals for a ban are estimated to reduce black carbon by just 5%, where a full ban on heavy fuel oil could reduce black carbon emissions by 30% in Arctic.
- - What are some solutions to help the Arctic?
  - No new investments in fossil fuels.
  - Phase out coal power.
  - Define a business roadmap for climate action.
  - Change shipping practices in the Arctic.
  - Improve food and water security.
  - Loss and damage payments.
- - How to align financial flows with net zero?
  - Businesses and governments should work towards putting a price on carbon, which allows companies to incorporate the externalities of their emissions accurately.
  - Businesses can begin by using an internal carbon price to support their transition plans.
  - Investors and financial institutions should invest in key technologies, especially in developing countries.
- - What are the adaptation, loss and damage practices?
  - Many developing countries already know that adaptation measures they need to put in place - put lack the finances to do so. This is critical for the countries that need to
- - What are some solutions to deal with extreme weather and sea-level rise?
  - One example of a solution for a nature-based infrastructure comprises of an artificial beach and dune landscape across 7 kilometres in Netherlands.
  - One example for a solution is The Coastal Forecasting Demonstration Project that provides an early warning system and alerts for coastal flooding in Pacific Island Countries.
- - How to improve food and water security?
  - Increase soil organic matter and erosion control, improve cropland, livestock, grazing land management.
  - Demand-side adaptation, such as adoption of healthy and sustainable diets, in conjunction with reduction in food loss and waste.
- - What is the concept of loss and damage payments?
  - The world's richest nations should follow through on their climate finance promise, originally made in 2009, to pay US$100bn to developing countries.
  - The UK House of Commons briefing highlights this target has been missed every year since 2013.
- - What are some regional solutions we can use to help the Arctic?
  - Build on indigenous intelligence and traditional knowledge.
  - More investment in the Arctic to help communities adapt to climate change.
- - Does oversleeping cause depression?
  - It's important to remember that oversleeping is a possible symptom of depression and that oversleeping doesn't cause depression. But it can exacerbate and worsen depression symptoms
- - How to utilize the knowledge of indigenous communities?
  - There are organizations such as Indigenous Guardians and Wildfire Management which utilize indigenous knowledge to build models for environmental management, fire stewardship, and increasing biodiversity on our planet.
  - One example of such a practice is utilizing the knowledge of The Inuit community in Canada to produce sea ice charts for the Sea Ice Climate Atlas.
- - How can we create more investment in the Arctic?
  - Investment from the private sector to support resilience.
  - Social enterprise serves as a model for resilience in the Arctic and globally.
  - One such example of a social enterprise is: SmartICE. SmartICE partners with Arctic Indigenous communities to empower them to monitor the ice that not only acts as their harvesting platform and travel highway but is central to their culture and identity.
- - How to support environmental management in the Arctic?
  - It is important to protect forests and peatland that can limit permafrost disruption.
  - Areas with herds of large Arctic herbivores like reindeer, horses and bison have a soil temperature about 2 degrees colder compared to herd-free areas. Strategically resettling herds like these could help preserve the Arctic's permafrost.
- - How to monitor the effects of climate change in the Arctic?
  - Monitoring changes in vegetation and permafrost thaw in the Arctic combined with distributed monitoring systems can highlight regions for preservation.
  - Emissions tracking can give rise to improved understanding of polluted transport into and out of the Arctic from extractive industries.
- - How is Arctic Basecamp helping the challenges in the Arctic?
  - Arctic Basecamp is a not-for-profit organization headquarted in the Netherlands. Our mission is to "speak science to power" and communicate how the Arctic is a critical barometer for, and a driver of, global risk. We support urgent low carbon action on insightful analysis that is supported by robust, rigorous and cutting-edge science.
  - By sharing knowledge and science, Arctic Basecamp works with partners to call for urgent action from global leaders to mitigate, adapt and build resilience to global risks from climate.
